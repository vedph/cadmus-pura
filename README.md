# Cadmus PURA Parts

Components for the [PURA project in Cadmus](https://github.com/vedph/cadmus_pura_doc).

## Setting up Graph

Preload nodes, mappings, and a selection of thesauri:

```ps1
.\cadmus-tool graph-add C:\Users\dfusi\Desktop\PresetNodes.json cadmus-pura .\plugins\Cadmus.Cli.Plugin.Pura\seed-profile.json repository-factory-provider.pura

.\cadmus-tool graph-add C:\Users\dfusi\Desktop\PresetMappings.json cadmus-pura .\plugins\Cadmus.Cli.Plugin.Pura\seed-profile.json repository-factory-provider.pura -t M

.\cadmus-tool graph-add C:\Users\dfusi\Desktop\PresetThesauri.json cadmus-pura .\plugins\Cadmus.Cli.Plugin.Pura\seed-profile.json repository-factory-provider.pura -t T -p x:categories/
```

Usually, this should be done only once.

You can find these files under `Cadmus.Pura.Parts.Test/Assets`. Note that currently the `x:` URIs are just for the sake of testing.
